# ðŸª™ Welcome to our Company's Responsible AI Development Question and Answer Chatbot!

As you know, AI is a hot topic, and our company is engaged in developing software 
applications.  We believe that we will inevitably be developing software that utilizes
AI, but people are rightfully concerned about the implications of using AI.  Nobody seems to understand
the riht way to think about building ethical and useful AI applications for enterprises.  

I am here to help you understand how the AI industry is evolving, especially as it relates to politics.
Many people believe that the best guidance is likely to come from the government, so I have thoroughly
read two important documents:

1.  White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, Making Automated Systems Work for the American People, October 2022
2.  Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework: Generative Artificial Intelligence Profile (NIST AI 600-1)

Ask me questions about AI, its implications, where the industry is heading, etc.  I will try to help!

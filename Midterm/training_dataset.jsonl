Throughout this framework the term \u201calgorithmic discrimination\u201d takes this meaning (and \nnot a technical understanding of discrimination as distinguishing between items). \nAUTOMATED SYSTEM: An \"automated system\" is any system, software, or process that uses computation as \nwhole or part of a system to determine outcomes, make or aid decisions, inform policy implementation, collect \ndata or observations, or otherwise interact with individuals and/or communities. Automated systems \ninclude, but are not limited to, systems derived from machine learning, statistics, or other data processing \nor artificial intelligence techniques, and exclude passive computing infrastructure. \u201cPassive computing \ninfrastructure\u201d is any intermediary technology that does not influence or determine the outcome of decision,", "608dfdd6-3281-4c4b-bcc4-d2f0cc32926e": "or artificial intelligence techniques, and exclude passive computing infrastructure. \u201cPassive computing \ninfrastructure\u201d is any intermediary technology that does not influence or determine the outcome of decision, \nmake or aid in decisions, inform policy implementation, or collect data or observations, including web \nhosting, domain registration, networking, caching, data storage, or cybersecurity. Throughout this \nframework, automated systems that are considered in scope are only those that have the potential to \nmeaningfully impact individuals\u2019 or communi-ties\u2019 rights, opportunities, or access. \nCOMMUNITIES: \u201cCommunities\u201d include: neighborhoods; social network connections (both online and \noffline); families (construed broadly); people connected by affinity, identity, or shared traits; and formal organi-\nzational ties. This includes Tribes, Clans, Bands, Rancherias, Villages, and other Indigenous communities. AI \nand other data-driven automated systems most directly collect data on, make inferences about, and may cause \nharm to individuals.

For these reasons, the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights asserts that the harms of automated \nsystems should be evaluated, protected against, and redressed at both the individual and community levels. \nEQUITY: \u201cEquity\u201d means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals. \nSystemic, fair, and just treatment must take into account the status of individuals who belong to underserved \ncommunities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American \npersons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; \nwomen, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) \npersons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely \naffected by persistent poverty or inequality. \nRIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, OR ACCESS: \u201cRights, opportunities, or access\u201d is used to indicate the scoping \nof this framework.

AI RMF pro\ufb01les assist organizations in deciding how to \nbest manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory \nrequirements and best practices, and re\ufb02ects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF \npro\ufb01les, this pro\ufb01le o\ufb00ers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle \nand for GAI as a technology.  \nAs GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document", "efb74c1a-095a-419a-9d61-5d5ffdc0290d": "and for GAI as a technology.  \nAs GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document \nis an AI RMF cross-sectoral pro\ufb01le. Cross-sectoral pro\ufb01les can be used to govern, map, measure, and \nmanage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of \nlarge language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition. \nThis document de\ufb01nes risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI. After introducing and \ndescribing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, \nmap, measure, and manage these risks. \n \n \n1 EO 14110 de\ufb01nes Generative AI as \u201cthe class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input \ndata in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital \ncontent.\u201d While not all GAI is derived from foundation models, for purposes of this document, GAI generally refers \nto generative foundation models.

Other risks may be unlikely to materialize in a given \ncontext, or may be more speculative and therefore uncertain. \nAI risks can di\ufb00er from or intensify traditional software risks.

While \nsuch statistical prediction can produce factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce \noutputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent.

This poses a challenge for \nmany real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient \ninformation reports could cause doctors to make incorrect diagnoses and/or recommend the wrong \ntreatments.

Similarly, an LLM could falsely assert that it is human or has human traits, \npotentially deceiving humans into believing they are speaking with another human. \nThe extent to which humans can be deceived by LLMs, the mechanisms by which this may occur, and the \npotential risks from adversarial prompting of such behavior are emerging areas of study.

Harmful Bias and Homogenization \nBias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in automated systems. AI systems, including GAI \nsystems, can increase the speed and scale at which harmful biases manifest and are acted upon, \npotentially perpetuating and amplifying harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and \nsociety.

For example, when prompted to generate images of CEOs, doctors, lawyers, and judges, current \ntext-to-image models underrepresent women and/or racial minorities, and people with disabilities. \nImage generator models have also produced biased or stereotyped output for various demographic \ngroups and have di\ufb03culty producing non-stereotyped content even when the prompt speci\ufb01cally \nrequests image features that are inconsistent with the stereotypes. Harmful bias in GAI models, which \nmay stem from their training data, can also cause representational harms or perpetuate or exacerbate \nbias based on race, gender, disability, or other protected classes.  \nHarmful bias in GAI systems can also lead to harms via disparities between how a model performs for \ndi\ufb00erent subgroups or languages (e.g., an LLM may perform less well for non-English languages or \ncertain dialects).

Information Security \nInformation security for computer systems and data is a mature \ufb01eld with widely accepted and \nstandardized practices for o\ufb00ensive and defensive cyber capabilities. GAI-based systems present two \nprimary information security risks: GAI could potentially discover or enable new cybersecurity risks by \nlowering the barriers for or easing automated exercise of o\ufb00ensive capabilities; simultaneously, it \nexpands the available attack surface, as GAI itself is vulnerable to attacks like prompt injection or data \npoisoning.  \nO\ufb00ensive cyber capabilities advanced by GAI systems may augment cybersecurity attacks such as \nhacking, malware, and phishing.

Sophisticated threat \nactors might further these risks by developing GAI-powered security co-pilots for use in several parts of \nthe attack chain, including informing attackers on how to proactively evade threat detection and escalate \nprivileges after gaining system access. \nInformation security for GAI models and systems also includes maintaining availability of the GAI system \nand the integrity and (when applicable) the con\ufb01dentiality of the GAI code, training data, and model \nweights.

Indirect prompt injection attacks occur when adversaries remotely (i.e., without \na direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be \nretrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit \nvulnerabilities by stealing proprietary data or running malicious code remotely on a machine. Merely \nquerying a closed production model can elicit previously undisclosed information about that model. \nAnother cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning, in which an adversary compromises a training \ndataset used by a model to manipulate its outputs or operation.

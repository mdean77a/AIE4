## Project Ideas
This document is an informal place for me to record ideas for final projects.  Here are some preliminary ideas:
- Common Data Element (CDE) retrieval system that allows clinical data managers to enter a phrase describing a specific data element and returns curated CDEs from the NIH.
- Application that can create a bespoke startup checklist for clinical sites in multicenter trials.
- Application that can create training materials and quizzes about a protocol.

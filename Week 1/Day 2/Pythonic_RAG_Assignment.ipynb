        "Synchronous methods block execution until they have completed and this is disadvantageous when making calls to a server, for example.  In our case, we are getting embeddings from OpenAI, which means we are making HTTP calls (under the hood).  By making the methods asynchronous by using `async def` then we are making the method non-blocking;  the calling code uses `await` in front of the method call, but the program can continue to execute other events.  Essentially, in the `EmbeddingModel` class, the `async_get_embedding(s)` methods are defined as asynchronous.  In our `VectorDatabase` class, `abuild_from_list` (also defined as asynchronous) calls the methods in the `EmbeddingModel` class, preceding the call with the keyword `await`.\n",

        "\n",
        "The content of the prompt will affect the \"quality\" of response with respect to what we are trying to achieve, but I interpret this question to relate to getting more reproducible outputs for any prompt, regardless of whether the prompt is optimized for the task.  The parameter that immediately comes to mind is temperature, but there are several others:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Temperature - This is a value from 0 to 2 that controls randomness of selection for the next token.  If the temperature is set to zero, the next token will be greedily selected based on order of probability;  in practice, SOME randomness is introduced to prevent LLMs from going into repetitive loops, etc.  Increasing temperature increases randomness and for some purposes, enriches the potential responses of the model.  Decreasing the temperature reduces randomness to a minimum.  This obviously should enhance reproducibility.\n",
        "2.  Top P - This controls the fraction of likelihood based options that will be available for the model to consider when it samples the probability distribution and selects the next token.  Reducing this will increase reproducibility since the model will have a smaller probability distribution from which to select the next token.\n",
        "3.  Frequency penalty - This is designed to prevent the model from using the same tokens over and over, similar to what I mentioned above about having a zero temperature leading to loops and repetitions.  Increasing this penalty will encourage the model to use different tokens than are already in the response (based on frequency), which will reduce reproducibility.\n",
        "4.  Presence penalty - similar to frequency penalty except focuses on whether a token has appeared in the text so far (yes or no) rather than the frequency of the token in the existing text.\n",
        "\n",
        "As I understand this, you would not alter these latter three parameters if you are also manipulating temperature, and changing temperature is generally the way reproducibility is tweaked by users.  Changing the other parameters might be useful in very special use cases.\n",

            "The best way to write a loop in Python depends on your specific use case and what you want to achieve. However, here are some general tips and examples for some common looping structures in Python:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Using `for` loops\n",
            "The `for` loop is useful for iterating over items in a collection (like a list, tuple, or string).\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Looping through a list\n",
            "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
            "for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "    print(f\"I like {fruit}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Using `while` loops\n",
            "The `while` loop is great when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Looping until a condition is met\n",
            "count = 0\n",
            "while count < 5:\n",
            "    print(f\"Count is: {count}\")\n",
            "    count += 1  # Don't forget to update the condition!\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Using list comprehensions\n",
            "If you want to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing list, you can use a list comprehension, which is often more concise than a traditional loop.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Creating a new list with squares\n",
            "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
            "squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]\n",
            "print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Using `break` and `continue`\n",
            "You can use `break` to exit a loop early and `continue` to skip the current iteration and move to the next one.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example: Using break and continue\n",
            "for number in range(10):\n",
            "    if number == 5:\n",
            "        break  # Exit the loop when number is 5\n",
            "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",
            "        continue  # Skip even numbers\n",
            "    print(number)  # Outputs 1, 3\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### General Tips:\n",
            "- **Readability**: Make sure your loops are easy to read. Use descriptive variable names and avoid overly complex logic inside the loop.\n",
            "- **Performance**: For large datasets, be mindful of performance. Use built-in functions or libraries like `map()` or NumPy for efficiency when applicable.\n",
            "- **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Pay close attention to your loop conditions to avoid infinite loops.\n",
            "\n",
            "Using these techniques, you can write efficient and effective loops that suit your needs! If you have a specific scenario in mind, feel free to share, and I’d be happy to provide a more tailored example.\n"

By systematically simulating a large number of virtual trials (with 100,000 for the null scenario to accurately identify the success threshold), the design ensures that the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., claiming treatment is effective when it is not) is kept within an acceptable limit. Specifically, the trial is considered successful in demonstrating noninferiority if the probability of noninferiority (Pr(NI)) is greater than or equal to 0.982 for one or more durations of cold storage.

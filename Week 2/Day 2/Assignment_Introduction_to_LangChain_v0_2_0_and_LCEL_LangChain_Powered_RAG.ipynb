It provides modular components and tools to streamline the creation of various types of applications, such as chatbots, Generative Question-Answering (GQA) systems, summarization tools, and more.\\n\\nLangChain is built around several key concepts:\\n\\n1. **LLM Wrappers**: These are interfaces that connect to different large language models, allowing developers to leverage the capabilities of various LLMs without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.\\n\\n2. **Prompt Management**: LangChain facilitates the creation, formatting, and optimization of prompts, which are critical for guiding the behavior of LLMs effectively.\\n\\n3. **Chains**: These are sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities, which can include conditionals, loops, and other control structures. Chains allow for the construction of complex workflows that can process input and generate the desired output.\\n\\n4. **Data Augmented Generation (DAG)**: This involves augmenting the LLM's output with additional data sources or context to enhance the quality and relevance of the generated content.\\n\\n5. **Memory**: LangChain provides mechanisms for maintaining state or context across interactions, enabling more coherent and contextually aware conversations or processes.\\n\\n6. **Agents**: These are components that use LLMs to make decisions and take actions based on user input and other data. Agents can be used to build interactive applications that require a degree of autonomy and decision-making.\\n\\nLangChain aims to be a comprehensive solution for developers looking to harness the power of large language models, offering tools and infrastructure to simplify and enhance the development process.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 335, 'prompt_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 357}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3aa7262c27', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-f8e5aed5-42fb-4fee-b88d-91e580c34d61-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 22, 'output_tokens': 335, 'total_tokens': 357}\n"

If I use a CSVLoader from LangChain, it creates separate documents for each row and each document is sufficiently small that I don't need to do a further split.  So, if a large document can be converted to smaller documents without a splitter, then you can simply vectorize each document.\n",

If I chunk large enough to have those two pages in the same chunk, then if I query for inclusion criteria I will get the whole list.  If I chunk smaller, then some of the chunks won't have any semantic connection to \"inclusion criteria\" because that was only present in the initial chunk.  SO we could use a strategy of using small chunks but somehow attaching metadata to those chunks to point to larger documents, and then feed those larger documents into the context.  So do the query, hit at least one semantically close chunk, point to two pages that include the whole list of criteria, and feed the two pages to the LLM.\n",

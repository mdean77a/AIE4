        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

This could be fine in some situations where we want a phrase, but if that is the intention then the phrase could be a single string.  One example of a bad question is asking for THE most popular framework but expecting TWO answers (which turns out ok by luck because the papers say two of the most popular ...).  \n",
        "\n",
        "The questions must be precise.  For example, asking about who authored the QLoRA paper is a vague question, and in several of the experiments that I ran, a different paper was pulled instead of the \"original\" paper authored by Dettmers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "If \"as-is\" does not mean to freeze the must_mention() method above, then we could add some fuzziness in this method that would handle capitalization, different forms of the same word, etc.  For example, Nf4 and NormalFload would not pass the test about the data type.  I know that the paper mentions NF4 but the author of the example might mispell it as well.  But the significant improvement is\"parameter reduction\", but the required answer has to include \"reduce parameters\",  which will fail our exact match approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "I ran the evaluation later in this notebook three times, and the results were variable despite not changing any code nor evaluation models, as shown below.  This is largely because the metric overall (the method and the examples) have not been optimized.\n",

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. It uses techniques from information retrieval to find the most relevant content that can help answer the query.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: This part of the system generates a response based on the retrieved documents. It uses techniques from natural language generation to create coherent and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\n3. **Integration**: The retrieved documents are used to inform and guide the generation process. The generation model uses the information from the retrieved documents to produce a more accurate and contextually relevant response.\\n\\n### Key Benefits of RAG Systems:\\n- **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging relevant information from a large corpus, RAG systems can provide more accurate and detailed responses.\\n- **Contextual Relevance**: The retrieval component ensures that the generated responses are contextually relevant to the input query.\\n- **Scalability**: RAG systems can handle a wide range of queries by retrieving information from a vast corpus, making them scalable and versatile.\\n\\n### Applications:\\n- **Question Answering**: Providing detailed and accurate answers to user queries.\\n- **Customer Support**: Assisting in customer service by retrieving relevant information and generating helpful responses.\\n- **Content Creation**: Aiding in the creation of content by generating text based on retrieved information.\\n\\nOverall, RAG systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to enhance the quality of AI-generated responses.',\n",

Here are some key advancements:\\n\\n1. **Communication Efficiency**:\\n   - **Federated LoRA with Sparse Communication (FLASC)**: This approach applies sparsity to LoRA during communication, allowing clients to locally fine-tune the entire LoRA module. It achieves up to 10 times less communication while maintaining performance comparable to dense LoRA. This method also offers benefits in terms of heterogeneity and privacy.\\n\\n2. **Cost-Effective and Flexible Implementation**:\\n   - **Open LoRa for IoT**: This design and implementation allow users to conveniently build private LoRa networks for various IoT applications. The improved software architecture of the LoRa network server, which is open-source, ensures scalability and flexibility. The server is divided into four decoupled modules and uses a messaging system based on streaming data for interaction between modules.\\n\\n3. **Energy Efficiency and Large-Scale Deployment**:\\n   - **LoRa Networking for IoT**: LoRa networks meet the key requirements of IoT applications, such as low cost, large-scale deployment, and high energy efficiency. This makes it suitable for applications like smart cities and precision agriculture. The open standard of LoRa allows for the development of autonomous LPWAN networks without third-party infrastructure.\\n\\nThese improvements highlight the importance of considering system-specific constraints and provide a competitive baseline for future work in federated finetuning and IoT network implementations.',\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

        "\n",
        "Not sure what is meant by improving this metric \"as-is\" but I presume this means to leave the must_mention function as written.  If this is correct assumption, then improving this metric is dependent on being more careful with the question/answer data.  For example, using pairs of words in the must_mention lists forces BOTH words to be found.  This could be fine in some situations where we want a phrase, but if that is the intention then the phrase could be a single string.  One example of a bad question is asking for THE most popular framework but expecting TWO answers (which turns out ok by luck because the papers say two of the most popular ...).  \n",
        "\n",
        "The questions must be precise.  For example, asking about who authored the QLoRA paper is a vague question, and in several of the experiments that I ran, a different paper was pulled instead of the \"original\" paper authored by Dettmers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "If \"as-is\" does not mean to freeze the must_mention() method above, then we could add some fuzziness in this method that would handle capitalization, different forms of the same word, etc.  For example, Nf4 and NormalFload would not pass the test about the data type.  I know that the paper mentions NF4 but the author of the example might mispell it as well.  But the significant improvement is\"parameter reduction\", but the required answer has to include \"reduce parameters\",  which will fail our exact match approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "I ran the evaluation later in this notebook three times USING THE ORIGINAL EXAMPLES, and the results were variable despite not changing any code nor evaluation models, as shown below.  This is largely because the metric overall (the method and the examples) have not been optimized.\n",

Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a large corpus of documents or a database. It uses techniques from information retrieval to find documents or passages that are most relevant to the input query or context.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: This part of the system is a generative model, often based on neural networks like transformers (e.g., GPT-3). It takes the retrieved information and the input query or context to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.\\n\\n3. **Integration**: The retrieved information is used to augment the input to the generative model. This can be done in various ways, such as concatenating the retrieved text with the input query or using more sophisticated methods to integrate the information.\\n\\n### How It Works\\n\\n1. **Input Query**: The system receives an input query or prompt.\\n2. **Retrieval**: The retrieval component searches a large corpus to find relevant documents or passages.\\n3. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is combined with the input query.\\n4. **Generation**: The augmented input is fed into the generative model, which produces the final output text.\\n\\n### Benefits\\n\\n- **Improved Relevance**: By incorporating relevant information from a large corpus, the system can generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\\n- **Knowledge Integration**: The system can leverage external knowledge sources, making it more knowledgeable and versatile.\\n- **Efficiency**: Combining retrieval and generation can be more efficient than relying solely on a generative model, especially for complex queries that require specific information.\\n\\n### Applications\\n\\n- **Question Answering**: Providing detailed and accurate answers to user queries.\\n- **Content Creation**: Assisting in writing articles, reports, or other content by providing relevant information and context.\\n- **Customer Support**: Enhancing automated customer support systems by generating more accurate and helpful responses.\\n\\nOverall, RAG systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to produce high-quality, contextually relevant text.\",\n",

Here are some key advancements:\\n\\n1. **Communication Efficiency**:\\n   - **Federated LoRA with Sparse Communication (FLASC)**: This method applies sparsity to LoRA during communication, allowing clients to locally fine-tune the entire LoRA module. It achieves up to 10 times less communication while maintaining performance comparable to dense LoRA. This is particularly beneficial in communication-constrained settings like cross-device federated learning.\\n\\n2. **System-Specific Constraints**:\\n   - The FLASC approach highlights the importance of considering system-specific constraints when developing communication-efficient finetuning approaches. It also offers benefits in terms of heterogeneity and privacy, which are crucial in federated learning environments.\\n\\n3. **IoT Applications**:\\n   - **Open LoRa for IoT**: This design and implementation allow users to build private LoRa networks for various IoT applications. The improved software architecture of the LoRa network server, which is open-source, ensures scalability and flexibility. This is achieved by dividing the server into four decoupled modules and using a messaging system based on streaming data for interaction between modules.\\n\\n4. **Energy Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness**:\\n   - LoRa networks are designed to be low-cost and energy-efficient, making them suitable for large-scale IoT deployments. This is particularly important for applications like smart cities and precision agriculture.\\n\\n5. **Scalability and Flexibility**:\\n   - The modular design of the LoRa network server and the use of streaming data for module interaction ensure that the system can scale and adapt to different application requirements.\\n\\nOverall, these improvements make the LoRA system more efficient, flexible, and suitable for a wide range of applications, from federated learning to IoT deployments.',\n",

This helps in reducing the memory footprint and computational requirements.\\n   - **Vanilla LoRA**: Does not involve quantization. It focuses solely on the low-rank adaptation of the model weights.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**:\\n   - **QLoRA**: More memory-efficient due to the quantization of weights. This allows for the fine-tuning of larger models on hardware with limited memory.\\n   - **Vanilla LoRA**: While it is more memory-efficient than full fine-tuning, it does not achieve the same level of memory reduction as QLoRA because it does not use quantization.\\n\\n3. **Training Speed**:\\n   - **QLoRA**: Potentially faster training due to the reduced precision of weights, which can lead to faster computations.\\n   - **Vanilla LoRA**: Training speed is generally slower compared to QLoRA because it operates with full-precision weights.\\n\\n4. **Implementation Complexity**:\\n   - **QLoRA**: More complex to implement due to the additional step of quantization and the need to manage lower precision arithmetic.\\n   - **Vanilla LoRA**: Simpler to implement as it only involves the low-rank adaptation without any quantization.\\n\\n5. **Performance**:\\n   - **QLoRA**: Can achieve similar or sometimes better performance compared to vanilla LoRA due to the efficient use of memory and computational resources, allowing for the fine-tuning of larger models.\\n   - **Vanilla LoRA**: Performance is generally good, but it may be limited by the available hardware resources, especially for very large models.\\n\\nIn summary, QLoRA extends the concept of LoRA by incorporating quantization techniques to further reduce memory and computational requirements, making it more suitable for fine-tuning very large models on resource-constrained hardware.',\n",

Understand the steps and components of attention mechanism architecture and see examples of its applications. 1. Introduction. Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning. It plays a pivotal role in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. Attention mechanism is a fundamental invention in artificial intelligence and machine learning, redefining the capabilities of deep learning models.

These included NIHS, topic retrieval, and long-context language understanding tasks.\\n\\n4. **Preservation of Model Integrity**: Despite the significant increase in context handling capability, the model well preserved its original functionality and performance metrics.\\n\\nThese improvements highlight a significant step forward in the capabilities of language models in handling and processing long-context scenarios, making them more useful for complex tasks involving large volumes of data.', name='Search')]}}\n",

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover \\nadditional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of \\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the \\nState Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, \\nthe General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court’s \\ndecision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023.

The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article \\n5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed \\nthrough the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, \\nwhich relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the \\nCommission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are \\nin breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the \\nCompany’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the \\nCommission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose \\nfines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the \\nGeneral Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, \\nunless a stay of the order is granted.

In addition, various civil litigation matters \\nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary \\ndamages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend \\nitself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District \\nCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based \\nupon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App \\nStore Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from \\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than \\nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, \\n2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California \\nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the \\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and \\nintends to vigorously defend itself.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \\nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in \\nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results.

            "Contexts: ['PART II  —  OTHER INFORMATION\\nItem 1. \\nLegal Proceedings\\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the \\nCompany under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article \\n5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed \\nthrough the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, \\nwhich relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the \\nCommission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are \\nin breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the \\nCompany’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the \\nCommission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose \\nfines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the \\nGeneral Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, \\nunless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes \\nto its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil \\nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or \\nattempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. \\nThe DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters \\nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary \\ndamages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend \\nitself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District \\nCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based \\nupon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App \\nStore Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from \\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than \\nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, \\n2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California \\nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the \\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and \\nintends to vigorously defend itself.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \\nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in \\nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is \\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above \\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially \\nadversely affected.\\nItem 1A. \\nRisk Factors\\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of \\nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, \\nItem 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarter']\n",

However, whether this is a significant increase (from 11/20 to 13/20 correct) is not clear, and probably the experiment should have repetitions to look at variability. Changing the embedding model MIGHT have impacted this metric.  THe Dopeness clearly exploded from only 1/20 initially to 18/20, due to the specific prompt change.  Helpfulness did not change, and given that the correctness only changed slightly, this is probably expected.  Also it is not clear how adding dopeness might affect the helpfulness metric.\n",
